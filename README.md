# GAQ
GO Annotation Quality (GAQ) Score

Use this tool to calculate the quality of GO annotations associated with a set of gene products. This tool allows user to quantitatively assess GO annotation of a set of gene products. The GAQ score includes breadth of GO annotation, level of detail for annotation and type of evidence used to make the annotation. The output is a summary of total GAQ scores for each gene product, the number of gene products annotated and the average (mean) GAQ score of the whole set.
